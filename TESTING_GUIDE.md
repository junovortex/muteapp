# MuteApp Testing Guide

## Project Status ✅

**BUILD STATUS: SUCCESSFUL** 

All API compatibility issues have been resolved and the project builds successfully.

## APK Files Available

- **Debug APK**: `./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
- **Release APK**: `./app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Physical Android Device Testing

1. **Enable Developer Options** on your Android device:
   - Go to Settings > About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Go back to Settings > Developer Options
   - Enable "USB Debugging"

2. **Install the APK**:
   ```bash
   # Connect your device via USB
   adb install ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

3. **Alternative Installation**:
   - Transfer the APK file to your device
   - Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Settings
   - Open the APK file to install

### Option 2: Android Studio Emulator

Due to disk space constraints on the current system, emulator setup was not completed. If you have Android Studio installed:

1. Open Android Studio
2. Create a new AVD with API level 21+ and Google APIs
3. Install the APK using: `adb install ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## App Features to Test

### 1. Google Sign-In Authentication ✅
**Status**: Code implemented and built successfully

**Test Steps**:
1. Launch the app
2. Tap "Sign In with Google"
3. Complete Google authentication flow
4. Verify user name and email display correctly
5. Test sign out functionality

**Expected Behavior**:
- Google Sign-In dialog appears
- User credentials are displayed after successful login
- User data is cached for offline support

### 2. Floating Button Service ✅
**Status**: Code implemented with proper API compatibility

**Test Steps**:
1. After signing in, tap "Start Floating Button"
2. Grant overlay permission when prompted
3. Verify floating button appears on screen
4. Test mute/unmute functionality
5. Test button positioning and drag behavior

**Expected Behavior**:
- Permission dialog appears for overlay access
- Floating button appears after permission granted
- Button can be dragged around the screen
- Mute/unmute functionality works correctly

### 3. Offline Support ✅
**Status**: SharedPreferences implementation completed

**Test Steps**:
1. Sign in with Google while connected to internet
2. Close the app
3. Disconnect from internet
4. Reopen the app
5. Verify user data is still displayed

**Expected Behavior**:
- User remains "signed in" when offline
- Cached user name and email are displayed
- App functions without internet connection

### 4. System Permissions ✅
**Status**: API compatibility fixes implemented

**Test Steps**:
1. Test overlay permission request (API 23+)
2. Test notification permissions
3. Verify foreground service functionality

**Expected Behavior**:
- Proper permission dialogs appear
- App handles different API levels correctly
- No crashes on older Android versions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Fixed Issues ✅

1. **API Compatibility**: 
   - Fixed `Settings.canDrawOverlays()` calls for API < 23
   - Fixed `startForegroundService()` calls for API < 26
   - Added proper version checks using `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT`

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Updated Gradle wrapper to 7.5
   - Updated Android Gradle Plugin to 7.4.2
   - Added AndroidX and Jetifier support
   - Fixed duplicate resource conflicts

3. **Firebase Integration**:
   - Google Services configuration verified
   - Firebase Auth implementation completed
   - Proper error handling implemented

4. **Resource Management**:
   - Fixed launcher icon references
   - Updated backup rules configuration
   - Resolved lint errors

### Architecture Overview

- **MainActivity.kt**: Main UI with Google Sign-In and floating button controls
- **FloatingButtonService.kt**: Foreground service for overlay functionality
- **Firebase Auth**: Google Sign-In integration
- **SharedPreferences**: Offline data caching
- **System Overlay**: Floating button implementation

## Build Commands

```bash
# Clean and build project
./gradlew clean build

# Build debug APK only
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Install on connected device
adb install ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Google Sign-In Not Working**:
   - Ensure device has Google Play Services
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Firebase configuration

2. **Overlay Permission Denied**:
   - Manually grant permission in Settings > Apps > MuteApp > Display over other apps

3. **Floating Button Not Appearing**:
   - Check overlay permissions
   - Verify foreground service is running
   - Check device compatibility

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View app logs
adb logcat | grep MuteApp

# View system logs for permissions
adb logcat | grep -i permission

# Clear app data for fresh testing
adb shell pm clear com.muteapp.muteapp
```
